## :flashlight: &nbsp; Highlights	
:mortar_board: &nbsp; **Education**
* Postdoc in Machine Learning at *Stanford University*
  * Advised by [Prof. Jure Leskovec](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/)
  * Affiliated with [SNAP](http://snap.stanford.edu) and [Statistical Machine Learning Group](http://statsml.stanford.edu)
* PhD in Computer Science at *EPFL*

:man_technologist: &nbsp; **Experience**
* **Head of Applied Research** at *X, the moonshot factory (formerly Google[x])*
  * Worked on AI applied to Source Code, Large Language Models (including [PaLM-Coder](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html)!)
* **Research Scientist** at *Stanford University* and at *EPFL*
  * Contributed to several projects (funded by IARPA, DARPA, Samsung, Google, Amazon, ...) with a focus on Machine Learning (GNNs, Transformers, [Open Graph Benchmark](https://ogb.stanford.edu), etc.), Recommender Systems, Crowdsourcing, and Data Science.
* **Intern** at *MIT Media Lab* (w/ [Prof. Alex 'Sandy' Pentland](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/sandy/overview/)), *Yahoo Research* (w/ [Prof. Ricardo Baeza-Yates](http://www.baeza.cl)), and *Google*.
* **Co-founder** of [Sindice.com](http://sindice.com), the largest Semantic Web Search Engine (back in the days). The core technologies developed for Sindice evolved into:
  * a top-level Apache project, [Any23](https://any23.apache.org/index.html)
  * several contributions to Hadoop, Lucene and Solr
  * [Siren](https://siren.io), an investigative intelligence platform which secured $15M+ in funding -- _kudos to my amazing ex-colleagues :+1:_

:man_teacher: &nbsp; **Teaching**
* At *Stanford University*:
  * [**CS224W: Machine Learning with Graphs**](https://cs224w.stanford.edu) -- Co-instructor together with Prof. Jure Leskovec
  * [**CS246: Mining Massive Data Sets**](https://cs246.stanford.edu) -- Co-instructor together with Prof. Jure Leskovec
  * [**CS329S: Machine Learning Systems Design**](https://cs329s.stanford.edu) -- Advisor
  * [**CS341: Project in Mining Massive Data Sets**](https://cs341.stanford.edu) -- Instructor
* At *EPFL*:
  * [**Applied Data Analysis**](https://ada.epfl.ch) -- Created and taught the first edition of the course
    * ADA is now taught by my friend and research collaborator [Prof. Robert West](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/) (head of the [Data Science Lab](https://dlab.epfl.ch)), who masterfully improved the course in several areas
    * 2nd largest course offered by the CS department at EPFL, recently grown to ~400 students -- _kudos to Bob :+1:_
